f:T435,FIA New England is celebrating 75 years of Independent India under the banner of “The Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav”. In Hindi, the phrase Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav means the elixir of freedom, the elixir of inspiration for the fighters of independence endeavors, the energy of Independence, the elixir of Atma Nirbharta, the elixir of fresh thoughts and commitments. FIA NE President Mr. Abhishek said he is happy that just as Prime Minister Narendra Modi had envisioned, Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is taking the form of a mass movement, with people from every section of society participating in different programs across the state. This event will showcase to the entire globe the accomplishments of the independence movement and will reflect inspiration from the freedom fighters, self-reliance, fresh resolutions, and new visions. While we take pride in originating from our native country, India deemed the world’s largest democracy, we are equally as proud and grateful to be able to call the US our home, where democracy and personal freedom are held at the utmost priority.b:[["$","p",null,{"children":"Times are never actually repeated, and so are perhaps memorable events; that was the scene created in Boston, for celebrating India’s 75th Independence Anniversary."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"It happened, and it happened really big, in a city that is well known not only for its culture and history but more importantly, for being the birthplace of Revolution to gain freedom from the same colonial power that India gained freedom 75 years ago.

Our founding fathers fought for India’s freedom. Let’s make sure we know more about them by attending the 76th India Day Celebration organized by FIA”. He further said, “India should once again become a Vishwa Guru and the hub of innovation and knowledge. For that to happen, it is important to increase awareness about numerous aspects of Indian heritage and culture in our younger generations and inspire the young budding minds to absorb the values embedded in them.”"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"$f"}]]
