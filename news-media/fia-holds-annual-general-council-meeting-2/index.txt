e:T50a,In his address, Abhishek Singh, President FIA New England Chapter lauded the valuable contribution of Indian nationals residing in New England in the strengthening of the India, American partnership. He also emphasized the relevance of January 26th, which is a day of pride and honor for all Indians, and the core values enshrined in the Indian Constitution which are Justice, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. He also explained the importance of rights and duties. He said rights have real meaning only if individuals perform duties. A duty is something that someone is expected or required to do. In fact, rights and duties are two wheels on which the chariot of life moves forward smoothly. Life can become smoother if rights and duties go hand in hand and become complementary to each other. Rights are what we want others to do for us whereas duties are those acts which we should perform for others. Thus, a right comes with an obligation to show respect for the rights of others. The obligations that accompany rights are in the form of duties. If we have the right to enjoy public facilities like transport or health services, it becomes our duty to allow others to avail themselves the same. If we have the right to freedom, it becomes our duty not to misuse this and harm others.a:[["$","p",null,{"children":"Federation of Indian Association (FIA) New England, imbued with great patriotic zeal and fervor, celebrated the 73rd Republic Day on January 25, 2022, at Grand Worcester Union Station, 2 Washington Sq., Worcester, MA 01604 with the Indo-American Community, and other partners.
