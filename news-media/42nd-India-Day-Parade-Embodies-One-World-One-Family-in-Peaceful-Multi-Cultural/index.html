This year marked the 42nd celebration, drawing thousands of participants and spectators from the Indian-American community to celebrate their rich culture. The parade started at 12 PM local time at 38th Street and Madison Avenue. This year’s theme, “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - The World is One Family,” emphasizes social harmony and cultural unity, fostering a sense of belonging that transcends boundaries.</p>
<p>The Consulate General of India, led by CG Binaya S. Pradhan and DCG Dr. Varun Jeph, provided invaluable support for the event. CG Pradhan expressed his pride, stating, “It’s a moment to see the best of India represented here. We celebrate our cultural, historic, and educational achievements today.” Our phenomenal Grand Marshal Sonakshi Sinha took the lead at the parade, with her husband, Bollywood actor Zaheer Iqbal by her side. The guests of honor included the talented Indian actor Pankaj Tripathi and the charismatic Bhojpuri celebrity and public figure Manoj Tiwari.</p>
<p>FIA President Dr. Avinash Gupta highlighted the importance of the parade&#x27;s theme, &quot;Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,&quot; on India&#x27;s Independence Day. He stated, “On this day, we celebrate democracy, unity in diversity, and inclusiveness.” The parade showcased vibrant floats representing India&#x27;s diverse communities, including a grand 18x9x8 foot replica of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir, symbolizing a historic victory for all Indians. Other notable floats included the newly constructed Nalanda University, the world’s first residential university, founded in 427 CE and led by BJANA, GANA depicting the state of Gujarat in India, and many more.</p>
<p>The crowd was as loud and lively as the music played and colors worn as those in attendance celebrated 78 years of India&#x27;s independence. It was an inspiring display of inclusivity and unity in diversity, as individuals from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and religions came together to celebrate their love and pride for India. Each person proudly represented their unique Indian identity, transcending prejudices and celebrating their country by waving Indian and American flags in unison as one big family.</p>
<p>Swami Avdheshanand Giri Ji Maharaj, the respected spiritual leader of Juna Akhada, also graced the event, attracting a large crowd of devotees seeking his blessings. He mentioned that he had come to New York to take part in the India Day Parade at the request of the Indian-American community. “People are enthusiastic as they participate in the India Day Parade. Different tableaus featuring India&#x27;s divine culture, our Kalajayi, Mrityunjaya, and Sanatan culture, and its values are seen here. All tableaus are very wonderful here,’ he stated looking impressed.</p>
<p>Following the parade, attendees gathered at the Cultural Stage, where a variety of performances showcased India’s rich and diverse traditions. Manoj Tiwari, looking at the cheering crowds, said, &quot;Itna pyar dekhkar mujhe yakeen hai ki America mai bhi Bharat basata hai (Seeing so much love, I am convinced that India resides in America too) &quot;</p>
<p>Sonakshi Sinha expressed her gratitude for representing the nation, sharing her excitement as her father, Shatrughan Sinha, had served as Grand Marshal in 1985. All celebrities warmly engaged and entertained the audience, bringing their unique talents to the stage.</p>
<p>Pankaj Tripathi was visibly emotional upon seeing the Baba Ambedkar float, expressing his heartfelt gratitude: “The sheer amount of love and support from the diaspora here in the United States is truly overwhelming. Your presence makes us all proud.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>The festival featured a vibrant stage for cultural performances, where artists presented both traditional and contemporary Indian music and dance. The performances beautifully epitomized the theme of &quot;Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam&quot; – the world is one family. Each dance told a unique story, harmonizing the grace of Bharatnatyam and Kathak with the energetic beats of Bhangra and the joyful movements of Garba. This fusion created a breathtaking experience, celebrating unity in diversity. With over 45 booths and food stalls, attendees enjoyed a sensory feast of Indian cuisine and crafts. From spicy street food to handcrafted goods, the festival was a lively celebration of Indian culture in all its forms.</p>
<p>The India Day Parade 2024 was a resounding success, offering a joyful and immersive experience of Indian culture to New Yorkers and visitors alike. When asked about the mantra behind the parade’s success each year, FIA Chairman Ankur Vaidya stated, “Our mantra is our vibrant community and thriving diaspora, who are proud, inclusive, diverse, and, most importantly, united. May the United States and our motherland, India, reach new heights of success.”</p>
<p>This mega undertaking was made possible through the generous support of partners, including Holtech, Mount Sinai, The Consulate General of India-NY, State Bank of India, RWJ Barnabas, ICICI, Simplify TARA, Bombino, Andaaz, Landeed, Dunkin, Times Group, Bansal Foundation, Siddhivinayak Temple-USA, BJANA, GANA, AAPI, MOCAAPI, and ESB. Media outlets such as TV Asia, Parikh Worldwide Media, New India Abroad, South Asian Times, and many others played a crucial role in elevating this landmark event.</p>
<p>The festivities concluded with a grand Independence Gala held at the National Museum of the American Indians that brought together over 450 members of the Indian community and esteemed guests. Attendees enjoyed a diverse menu provided by Andaaz Restaurant, located in Franklin Park, NJ, which offered a delectable array of traditional Indian dishes. Manan Saxena, owner of Andaaz, also took the stage to discuss the banquet menu and its significance in supporting this initiative.</p>
<p>A key focus of the evening was the &quot;Zero Food Waste Mission,&quot; emphasized by Nirali and Rohit Korat, founders of Gracia Marcom, a purpose-driven agency that highlighted the importance of sustainability and minimizing food waste during the event.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the FIA team, including President Dr. Avinash Gupta, Chairman Ankur Vaidya, Senior Advisors Dr. Sudhir Parikh and Dr. H. R. Shah. Dr. Ravi Ranjan, a highly regarded anesthesiologist from Bihar, and Neena Singh, Mayor of Montgomery Township NJ, were among the many distinguished guests who added to the grand celebration.
